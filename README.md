This Perl tool performs a comprehensive DNS reconnaissance on a given domain, extracting A, NS, and MX records (with **Dnsenum** code).   Additionally, it runs discreet and fast **nmap** scans on the discovered IPs, detects Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) using **WafW00f** in a non-intrusive mode,   and  extracts metadata with **MetaFinder** for domain intelligence.
